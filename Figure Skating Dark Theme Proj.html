        <p>
            When figure skating was invented as a sport, between the eighteenth and the nineteenth century, it was
            totally different from figure skating nowdays.
            At the beginning the aim of this sport was to draw the most beautiful figures on the ice with blades. Since
            then the sport began to evolve,
            reaching increasingly higher levels of difficulty thanks to truly great and powerful athletes.
            During the twentyth century, artistic ice skating acquired an increasingly athletic character by developing
            different categories of elements,
            namely: jumps,spins, turns, steps and moves. Examples of the latest goals achieved were the execution of the
            quadruple axel, a jump with four and a half
            rotations in the air, and the execution of five quadruple jumps during the free-program in women figure
            skating:
            such things were impossible to even imagine 20 Years ago.
